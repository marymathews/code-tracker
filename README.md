# Code Tracker

## Some Context:
* Preparing for technical interviews can be overwhelming. Especially now, when there are hundreds of sites and books you can refer to, each having a massive variety of questions
* Each site typically provides stats about your problem-solving skills, but when you're using multiple resources, it can be confusing to figure out whether you're making any progress 
* Code Tracker is an Android app that allows you to do just that!
* It is a clean and simple way to keep track of your progress and improvement across different sites
* Using the app, you can enter data about the coding questions you have solved
* You can enter the problem name, the site on which you found the problem, a link to the problem, your approach to solving the problem, the amount of time you took, and a lot more 
* The app then provides insights like the average time spent on 'Easy' questions, the number of 'Easy' questions solved, and so on
* Ultimately, you get a straightforward consolidated view of all the questions solved across all the sites and platforms you have used
